# UnityMetaHaptics
This is a package for Unity that allows you to play Meta .haptics files on gamepad. It currently copies functionality from NiceVibrations, but I hope to improve upon the translation from frequency/amplitude to left/right motor. Also, this API has more features (and I think is nicer).
